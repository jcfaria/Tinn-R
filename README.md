### Tinn-R

This is the development code of the project **Tinn-R Editor - GUI for R Language and Environment**.
You should use it if you want to contribute to its development:
testing unreleased versions, fixing bugs, writing code, writing documentation, etc.

Tinn-R is free, simple but efficient replacement for the basic code editor provided by Rgui.
The project is coordinate by José Cláudio Faria/UESC/DCET.
All users are welcome to make it better!

LANGUAGE: *Object Pascal*, IDE: *DELPHI 2007*

To download do the following in a terminal emulator:

> git clone git://github.com/jcfaria/Tinn-R.git
>
> or
>
> git clone https://jcfaria@github.com/jcfaria/Tinn-R.git

A good option to keep track of developments and always use the most up-to-date version of Tinn-R
is to clone the project in a folder on your computer (git clone), after which, pin the executable
(Tinn_R.exe and Tinn_R_portable.exe) located in the Tinn-R/bin folder.
This is how I use it.
