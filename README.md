#### How to use the app after cloning the project?
A good option to keep track of developments and always use the most up-to-date version of Tinn-R
is to clone the project in a folder on your computer (git clone), after which, pin the executable
(Tinn_R.exe and Tinn_R_portable.exe) located in the Tinn-R/bin folder.
This is how I use it.
