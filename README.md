### Tinn-R
- LANGUAGE: *Object Pascal*

This is the development code of the project **Tinn-R Editor - GUI for R Language and Environment**.

You should use it if you want to contribute to its development:
testing unreleased versions, fixing bugs, writing code, writing documentation, etc.

Tinn-R is free, simple but efficient replacement for the basic code editor provided by Rgui.
The project is coordinate by José Cláudio Faria/UESC/DCET.
All users are welcome to make it better!
