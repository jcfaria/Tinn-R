 Tinn-R is an extension of Tinn that provides additional tools to control R
 (http://cran.r-project.org). The project is coordened by José Cláudio Faria
 (joseclaudio.faria@gmail.com).

 As such, Tinn-R is a feature-rich replacement of the basic script editor
 provided with Rgui. It provides syntax-highlighting, submission of code in
 whole, or line-by-line, and many other useful tools to ease writting and
 debugging of R code.
