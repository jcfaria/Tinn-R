<p>A lot of PRE-RELEASE versions of the project have been released, not restrict to testers. Thanks for testing and suggestions.</p>
<p>The installation of TinnRcom package (and its dependences) was improved. From now, the sources (.tar.gz) and the binaries (.zip) of the packages formatR, svMisc, svSocket and TinnRcom will be released within the setup of Tinn-R. After the installation, it will be placed at packages folder. So all will be installed from the local .zip.</p>
<p>The package TinnRcom was upgraded to the version 1.0.20.</p>
<p>The menu options has a new option: R echo (on/off). This grants the user the choice to acho (or not) some options of send file, selection, clipboard, block marked, contiguous lines a line to end of page. A related button was add to R task bar. This made simpler and user friendly these options. The default shortcut to toggle this option is ALT + E</p>
<p>The procedure to open a remote file from an URL was improved and also covers https protocol.</p>
<p>If the user choice in Options/Application/R/Patch (R) is No to Use latest installed version (always) option, at startup, Tinn-R will search in all letters of the system drives for the fully informed path of R. It is very useful in the portable flavours due to letters changes in different computers.
<p>The visibility of all Page Control and Tab Sheets caption were improved.</p>
<p>R will always start with two options:<br>
- options(pkgType='binary')<br>
- options(install.packages.check.source='no')</p>
