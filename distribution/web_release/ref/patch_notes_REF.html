<ul>
<li><p>Some parts of the Object Pascal <strong>pipe</strong> were rewritten. It is now faster, stable and robust.</p></li>
<li><p>The handling of all shortcuts, keystrokes and hotkeys are now centered on a single user interface that is simpler and more efficient than previous options. As result, a new menu option has been created: <code>Options/Shortcuts/keystrokes/hotkeys (map)</code>. It was a very hard and time consuming work, we hope you enjoy the final results.</p></li>
<li><p>We are looking for the maximum freedom and efficiency to interact with the R interpreter. Thus, improvements have been made to the <code>Rterm IO</code> interface:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>From now on, to send any prior line (or just any selection) to the R interpreter, you must press the <strong>CTRL + ENTER</strong> shortcut keys (not configurable).</p></li>
<li><p>In the latest line the user can use: a simple <strong>ENTER</strong> or <strong>CTRL + ENTER</strong> to send the current line.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>R history</code> can be visualized (and filtered progressively as you type) in a new <code>SynEdit completion window</code>. The shortcut is <strong>CTRL + ALT + SPACE</strong> (not configurable).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>From now on, the shortcut <strong>CTRL + ENTER</strong> (not configurable) is also associated to send line (or selection) from the Editor to the interpreter. The previous use (send the current line and insert a new one) was removed. This was an old request from users but we believe it is no longer used much. Therefore, unless otherwise stated, we don’t wish wish to make this feature available anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>The option to send the clipboard content, with shortcut <strong>CTRL + Q</strong> by default, to interpreter was removed.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>R highlighter</code> was improved, it has new objects and from now on, will not be case sensitive, that is, it will highlight, for example, <strong>LETTERS, letters, CO2, co2, …</strong> in the same way.</p></li>
<li><p>From this version, the instructions stored in <code>R history</code> are only those typed in and submitted directly into <code>Rterm IO</code> interface.</p></li>
<li><p>The highlighter identifier <code>Note</code> was renamed to <code>Note_0</code>. It makes more sense, since <code>Note_1</code> and <code>Note_2</code> were created in previous version.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to low usage, all shortcuts (default) associated with Txt2tags to Deplate converters have been removed.</p></li>
<li><p>A new shortcut (default) has been associated with the option <code>Save file as: SHIFT+CTRL+S</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The interface <code>Highlighters setting</code> was improved. From now on, the program will be distributed with at least 4 fast coloring sets: Default, Dark, Gray and LGray. Additionally, the interface allows you to restore all default values with a new option.</p></li>
</ul>
