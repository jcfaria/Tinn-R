\subsection*{5.3.2.1 (fev/12/2019)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The recognition of complex R object names for \texttt{print}, \texttt{plot}, \texttt{names}
    \texttt{structure}, \texttt{edit}, \texttt{fix}, \texttt{help}, \texttt{example} and \texttt{open example}
      were improved. For example, to all cases:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item iris
      \item iris[1]
      \item iris[c(1, 2)]
      \item iris3(1, 1, 3)
      \item iris\$Sepal.Length
      \item iris['Sepal.Length']
      \item iris[["Sepal.Length"]]
    \end{itemize}
    that it will be correctly recognized.
  \item The \texttt{Replace} procedure was improved. From now it will remember, for all files, the same
    word list used to replacement.
  \item The \htmladdnormallink{Tinn-R web site}{https://nbcgib.uesc.br/tinnr/en/} was updated,
    the new URL is: \textbf{https://nbcgib.uesc.br/tinnr/en/}.
